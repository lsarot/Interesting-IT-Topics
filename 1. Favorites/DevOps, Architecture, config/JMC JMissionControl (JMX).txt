JMC JMissionControl (JMX)

JMC (JavaMissionControl) for managing local or remote JVM (JMC is a JMX client, as JConsole, but more supported).

First you need to enable the external JMX agent on the server. They disable security and authentication, so NEVER use it like this in production:

-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=7091
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false

In case it still doesn't work try adding -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=<ip>

In case of firewalls, SSH-tunnelling, etc. use
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.port=[...] (mismo que port), is needed to let the client access remote RMI-objects through the tunnel using a known port instead of a random one.
-Djava.rmi.server.hostname=[...] (localhost on ssh-tunnel) might be necessary as well.
