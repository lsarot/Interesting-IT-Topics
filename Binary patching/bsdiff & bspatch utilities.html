<b>bsdiff</b> and <b>bspatch</b> are tools for building and applying patches 
to binary files.  By using suffix sorting (specifically,
<a href="http://www.cs.lth.se/Research/Algorithms/Papers/jesper5.ps">
Larsson and Sadakane's qsufsort</a>) and taking advantage of how executable 
files change, <b>bsdiff</b> routinely produces binary patches 50-80% smaller 
than those produced by <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xdelta/">Xdelta</a>, and 15% smaller 
than those produced by <a 
href="http://www.pocketsoft.com/products.html">.RTPatch</a> (a $2750/seat 
commercial patch tool).
<p>
These programs were originally named <b>bdiff</b> and <b>bpatch</b>, but the 
large number of other programs using those names lead to confusion; I'm not 
sure if the "bs" in refers to "binary software" (because <b>bsdiff</b> 
produces exceptionally small patches for executable files) or "bytewise 
subtraction" (which is the key to how well it performs).  Feel free to offer 
other suggestions.
<p>
<b>bsdiff</b> and <b>bspatch</b> use bzip2; by default they assume it is in 
/usr/bin.
<p>
<b>bsdiff</b> is quite memory-hungry.  It requires <i>max(17*n,9*n+m)+O(1)</i> 
bytes of memory, where <i>n</i> is the size of the old file and <i>m</i> is 
the size of the new file.  <b>bspatch</b> requires <i>n+m+O(1)</i> bytes.
<p>
<b>bsdiff</b> runs in <i>O((n+m) log n)</i> time; on a 200MHz Pentium Pro, 
building a binary patch for a 4MB file takes about 90 seconds. <b>bspatch</b> 
runs in <i>O(n+m)</i> time; on the same machine, applying that patch takes 
about two seconds.
<p>
Providing that <i>off_t</i> is defined properly, <b>bsdiff</b> and 
<b>bspatch</b> support files of up to 2^61-1 = 2Ei-1 bytes.
<p>
Version 4.3 is available <a href="bsdiff-4.3.tar.gz">here</a> with MD5 
hash <b>e6d812394f0e0ecc8d5df255aa1db22a</b>.  Version 4.2 is available 
in the FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD 
ports trees as misc/bsdiff, in Darwinports as devel/bsdiff, and in gentoo 
as dev-util/bsdiff.  It has also been made into a
<a href="http://starship.python.net/crew/atuining/cx_bsdiff/index.html">Python
extension module</a>, and there is a
<a href="http://sites.inka.de/tesla/f_others.html#bsdiff">Windows 
port</a> available.
<p>
The algorithm used by BSDiff 4 is described in my (unpublished) paper
<a href="/papers/bsdiff.pdf">Naive differences of executable code</a>;
please cite this in papers as

<p>
A far more sophisticated algorithm, which typically provides roughly 
20% smaller patches, is described in my
<a href="/papers/thesis.pdf">doctoral thesis</a>.
